## Instructions to run the app
Flutter version: stable 3.3.8
1. After cloning the repo, make sure you have the latest Flutter version installed (In this case v3.3.8).
2. After opening project on terminal run: "flutter pub get" to install dependencies.
3. To run unit tests, run: "flutter test" from the root of the project directory.
4. Now if you do not have any errors you must be ready to run. Please note that I have tested on IOS version 16.1 (iOS Simulator) and Pixel 3A Emulator (API v33) Android 13.
